# Timelock

OUSD, OETH, and OGV are all protected by timelock contracts, which prevent any on-chain upgrades from taking effect without Origin's community having advance notice of the impending change.



| Token                        | Timelock delay |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Origin Dollar (OUSD)         | 48 hours       |
| Origin Ether (OETH)          | 48 hours       |
| Origin DeFi Governance (OGV) | 48 hours       |
