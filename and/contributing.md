# 기여

**100% 오픈소스**

OUSD is an entirely open-source project and we welcome contributions of all sorts. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, contributing code, and helping us improve our community.

We work in public and our company Discord is open to all. If you have questions or need help getting started, our Discord OUSD channels are the best place to get assistance from our team and community.

## Development Process

Our branching strategy is similar to [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), but we do all of our development in the `master` branch and have a `stable` branch for code that has been released.

개발 과정은 다음과 같습니다:

1. 흥미로운 문제를 찾아 소통을 시작합니다! Please let the `#engineering` [Discord](https://discord.gg/jyxpUSe) channel know what you want to work on.
2. Ping a [core team member](https://github.com/orgs/OriginProtocol/teams/core/members) member on Discord and ask to be added to our [contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/OriginProtocol/teams/contributors). Otherwise, you’ll need to fork the relevant repository and push feature branches to your own fork.
3. Add a comment to the issue or self-assign so we don’t have multiple contributors unintentionally working on the same task.
4. Start with the `master` branch and check out a new feature branch unless you’re contributing to an existing feature.
5. Follow the appropriate [coding style](https://docs.originprotocol.com/guides/getting_started/contributing.html#contributing-email-coding-style) and write some awesome code.
6. Pull the latest commits from `master` and confirm that your code works with any other work that has been merged since you started.
7. Push your branch to the upstream repository \(i.e. [https://github.com/OriginProtocol/\[repo\]\](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/[repo]\)\) so that other contributors can easily work off of it if necessary.
8. Please request a review in the PR by clicking on the gear icon next to “Reviewers” in the right column.

The `master` branch is locked so that only members of the [core team](https://github.com/orgs/OriginProtocol/teams/core) are able to merge your pull requests. Pull requests that are peer-reviewed by other trusted contributors will be fast-tracked and merged faster! Check in the `#engineering` Discord channel for appropriate reviewers.

## 코딩 스타일

오리진은 리포지토리\(repositories\) 에서 다양한 프로그래밍 언어를 사용합니다. 기여 하실 때에는 기존 코딩 규약을 준수해주실 것을 부탁드리며, 만약 리포지토리에 CONTRIBUTING.md 파일이 있을 경우에는 해당 파일을 참조해주세요.

자바 스크립트의 경우에는, [prettier](https://prettier.io/)을 통해 자동으로 적용되는 [NPM 스타일](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style)을 사용합니다.

솔리티디\(Solidity\) 의 경우에는, 두 개의 공백 들여 쓰기를 사용합니다.

## 프로토콜 설계

When considering protocol or implementation design proposals, we are looking for:

* A description of the problem this design proposal solves
* Discussion of the trade-offs involved
* Review of other existing solutions
* Links to relevant literature \(RFCs, papers, etc\)
* Discussion of the proposed solution

Please note that protocol design is hard and meticulous work. You may need to review existing literature and think through generalized use cases.

## 커뮤니티 가이드라인

We want to keep the Origin community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your help to keep it that way. To help with this we’ve come up with some general guidelines for the community as a whole:

* Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members: no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!
* Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.
* Keep it legal: Basically, don’t get anybody in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don’t break laws.
* Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

## 문제 보고

If you find bugs, mistakes or inconsistencies in Origin’s code or documents, please let us know by filing a GitHub issue. No issue is too small. Help us fix our tpyos!

## 보안 이슈

OUSD is still in early development, which means there may be problems with the protocol or in our implementations. We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a security vulnerability please send your report privately to [security@originprotocol.com](mailto:security@originprotocol.com) or send an encrypted message to [@joshfraser on Keybase](https://keybase.io/joshfraser). Please DO NOT file a public issue. Be sure to review our guidelines for responsible disclosure and eligibility for bug bounties.

## **커뮤니티 개선**

Origin is just as much about community as it is about our technology.

We need constant help in improving our documentation, building new tools to interface with our platform, spreading the word to new users, helping new users getting setup and much more.

Please get in touch if you would like to help out. Our `general` channel on [Discord](https://www.originprotocol.com/discord) is a great place to share ideas and volunteer to help.

## 정규직

오리진\(Origin\) 은 간혹 파트 타임 또는 풀 타임 개발자를 채용합니다.

We have a strong preference for hiring people who have already started contributing to the project. If you want a full time position on our team, your best shot is to engage with our team and start contributing code. It is very unlikely that we would offer you a full-time position on our engineering team unless you’ve had at least a few pull requests merged.

If you are interested, check out [the Origin Protocol job listings](https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs). If you’d like to help in other ways, please propose your ideas in [our Discord channel](https://www.originprotocol.com/discord).
