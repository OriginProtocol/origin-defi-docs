# Risk Reports

We have performed a qualitative risk assessment of the underlying LSTs that OETH will consist of in order to provide an insight into the framework we have developed that we based our decision on.

**It is based on:**

* Smart Contract Practices
* Recent Audit Findings
* Peg Stability to ETH
* Liquidity & Composability
* Team
* Documentation
* Admin Controls
