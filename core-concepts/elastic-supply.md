# Elastic Supply

**Elastic Supply. Stable Price.**

OUSD works differently than most tokens. Instead of the price increasing as the value of the assets under management increase, the value of one OUSD remains constant at $1. Instead, the contracts constantly adjust the monetary supply and automatically updates the balance in every token holder’s wallet to reflect the yield that has been earned by the protocol.

Think of it as interest accruing in your bank account. The value of a dollar doesn’t change. You just get more of them over time as you earn interest.

This mechanism was inspired by the novel approach taken by [Ampleforth](https://www.ampleforth.org/), but there are some key differences that are worth highlighting:

1. OUSD is 100% backed by other stablecoins and should not have the same challenge maintaining the peg to the dollar. Given the ease of minting and redeeming OUSD, we can count on arbitrageurs to ensure the peg is maintained. 
2. Unlike Ampleforth which rebases once a day, the monetary supply of OUSD is constantly being updated in real-time as yield is generated.
3. Other than minor fluctuations in price due to the impact of the market, your principle should be protected as long as nothing goes wrong with the underlying protocols or backing stablecoins. Any major decrease in your balance would be an indication of trouble in the system.
