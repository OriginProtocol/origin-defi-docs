# Supported Stablecoins

**Supported Stablecoins**

It is important to understand that OUSD is only as strong as the stablecoins that are backing it. Any loss to the underlying assets will cause a similar loss to the value of OUSD.

Currently, OUSD supports the following stablecoins:

{% page-ref page="usdt.md" %}

{% page-ref page="usdc.md" %}

{% page-ref page="dai.md" %}

None of these stablecoins are perfect. They're not even that great at staying stable! 

In addition, each one introduces non-trivial counter-party risk. Tether, in particular, has had well-documented banking troubles and regulatory challenges. In addition, both USDT and USDC have backdoors that grant their issuers the power to freeze money in their holder's wallets. While DAI does not have any direct backdoors, it's assets can also be negatively impacted since USDC is accepted as collateral for minting DAI. 

Despite these concerns, there are already billions of dollars betting on the security of these stablecoins. It is possible that additional stablecoins will be added to the protocol over time. Support may also be removed if any of these stablecoins prove to be too unreliable or put OUSD holders funds in jeopardy.
