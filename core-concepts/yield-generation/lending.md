**Unbank the Banked**

DeFi lending platforms let users lend and borrow crypto assets without any middlemen. Both lenders and borrowers get more value from their crypto. Lenders earn interest, while borrowers deposit crypto as collateral to gain access to credit without traditional banking headaches. DeFi lending platforms can provide far superior returns for lenders than are generally available in the traditional markets.

OUSD integrates with DeFi lending platforms that provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization, combined with smart rules around liquidations, provide a reasonable level of security for lenders. Aave also additionally secures its lending pools with AAVE tokens respectively, further lowering risk.

OUSD integrates with leading lending providers that have a proven track record, audited smart contracts, and have successfully lent hundreds of millions of dollars without issue. We are currently integrated with the following lending platforms:
