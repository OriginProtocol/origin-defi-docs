# Earning Strategies

Earning strategies put deployed capital to work across various DeFi platforms. Each strategy is immutable once deployed. However, the Vault will determine which strategies are active and what percentage of deployed capital they will receive. 

For example, at launch, there will be an initial [Compound strategy](../supported-strategies/compound.md). Over time, this may be replaced by a v2 or v3 Compound strategy.
