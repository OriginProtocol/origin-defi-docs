As previously mentioned, Frax Staked Ether is not a supported collateral type to mint OETH. Instead, frxETH is accepted into the Origin Ether vault and used to mint Staked Frax Ether.  frxETH is a 100% collateralized, ether-pegged LSD used within the Frax ecosystem, but it does not inherently earn yield.

sfrxETH is an ERC-4626 vault and earns validator rewards from the ether collateral used to mint frxETH. Unlike stETH or rETH, sfrxETH rewards are accrued in a rewards pool and denominated in frxETH. When a user unstakes their sfrxETH, they receive their original frxETH collateral back in addition to frxETH rewards earned through staking.&#x20;

The price of sfrxETH increases relative to frxETH and ETH over time. This is because sfrxETH holders can claim frxETH plus accrued staking rewards. Frax takes a 10% fee from yield generated, 2% of which goes into a slashing insurance fund.
