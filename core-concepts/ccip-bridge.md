# CCIP Bridge

Origin DeFi provides users with an innovative and secure way to bridge between Ethereum and Arbitrum using [C_hainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)_](https://docs.chain.link/ccip)&#x20;

Bridges built using Chainlink CCIP use arbitrary messaging that triggers an informed action on the receiving smart contract and programmable token transfers to transfer data and tokens in a single transaction.

CCIP is built to be highly-secure in a scaleable manner and it uses a [Risk Management Network](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/concepts#risk-management-network) to continously monitor malicious activity.

Origin has been one of the few selected protocol to go live with CCIP on launch as it is poised to become a fundamental piece of cross-chain interoperability.&#x20;

By using the integrated CCIP Bridge on our {UI) you can seamlessly bridge back and forth between Ethereum and Arbitrum.

### How to Bridge

To use the bridge, you have to acquire wOETH on our UI first by minting OETH and wrapping it into wOETH.&#x20;

After your funds have been converted into wOETH, visit the bridge {interface} and select wOETH to be bridged from Ethereum to Arbitrum or vice versa.&#x20;

Input the amount you want to transfer, select the destination chain of choice, and click bridge. You must approve the contract to use your wOETH for bridging purposes before completing it successfully.&#x20;
