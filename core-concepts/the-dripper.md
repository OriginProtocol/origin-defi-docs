# The Dripper

The dripper contract receives 100% of the yield that is generated by the protocol and slowly distributes it to OUSD or OETH holders over a 7-day period. This smooths out the otherwise choppy yield and prevents attackers from being able to front-run large liquidity events for the protocol.

Below you can see how daily APYs changed after the Dripper was implemented:
