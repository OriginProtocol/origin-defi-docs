# Governance Templates

Use these guides as a reference for writing governance proposals for OUSD, OETH, OGV, or OGN. Discuss the proposal in the Discord channel #defi-governance-forum before submitting the proposal to Snapshot. A tool like Google Docs or Notion may be used if the proposal is longer than the Discord or Snapshot character limit.
