## Strategy Evaluation

#### Overview

_In a few sentences, how does the protocol work? How do depositors earn yield?_&#x20;

#### Relationship to Protocol

_What is the relationship between the author of this proposal and the proposed yield protocol?_

### Projected Returns

#### Base APY

_What level of yield can OUSD collateral earn, without included liquidity mining incentives? How does it compare to the current OUSD yield strategies? Keep in mind that new strategies often have investment caps of 100k USDC/USDT/DAI_

#### Liquidity Incentives

_What additional yield can be generated from liquidity mining incentives? Are the bonus tokens locked for a period of time?_&#x20;

#### Total Projected Yield

_Combine the previous two sections in this format, with X as base APY, Y as bonus APY, and Z as the bonus tokens:_

_USDC: XXX% + YYY% in ZZZ_

_USDT: XXX% + YYY% in ZZZ_

_DAI: XXX% + YYY% in ZZZ_

### TVL & Liquidity

#### TVL

_What is the project’s current TVL? Average TVL over the past 90 days? Peak TVL? Include any on-chain reporting, such as Dune queries and Defi Llama pages. If possible, please do not include staking in these numbers._&#x20;

#### Liquidity

_What level of liquidity depth does the project have? Does the project maintain healthy pools on Uniswap, Curve, or another DEX? How easily can the bonus tokens be converted into stablecoin? How easily can deposits be pulled from the protocol?_&#x20;

## Project Details

#### Project Overview

_How big is the project team? When did the project launch? How much did the project raise? Who are the main investors?_&#x20;

## Security Considerations

#### Risks

_What are the risks with utilizing the protocol with this yield strategy? How is the project mitigating each risk?_

#### Access Control/Upgradability

#### Audits

_How many audits has the project formally completed? When was the last audit completed?_

#### Previous Hacks
