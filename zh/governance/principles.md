**渐进式去中心化**

我们希望 OUSD 能够成为一个由世界各地的许多利益相关者管理的一个去中心化协议。 We believe that the holders of OUSD should collectively determine important protocol decisions as soon as possible.

但是在OUSD的早期，核心工程团队必须能够迅速而果断地采取行动，以构建协议的基础部分。

在接下来的几个月里，OUSD的去中心化将通过四个阶段快速进行。 我们的目标是尽快将控制权和治理权移交给社区。

**Governance Portal**

OGN holders are encouraged to participate in creating and voting on proposals that impact the protocol in the [OGN governance portal](https://vote.originprotocol.com). Anyone with at least 1,000 OGN in their wallet or staked in our OGN Staking contract can create a new proposal. All OGN holders are able to vote for proposals. Our desire is for our community to have a strong impact on the direction of Origin’s products, open-source codebase, and to have a voice in key business decisions and the overall direction of the project.

**Timelock**

Prior to full decentralized governance, we will implement a [timelock](../smart-contracts/api/timelock.md) in front of all admin function calls, giving OUSD users time to withdraw their funds if they have objections to our proposed upgrades.

**New and Existing Stakeholders**

OUSD is a new project founded by Origin Protocol [team](www.originprotocol.com/team) and will be supported by the existing Origin community as well as many new stakeholders that choose to mint, hold, use, and provide liquidity for OUSD.

In addition, we also want to ensure high participation from our existing Origin Token \(OGN\) holders and the millions of people in our community. Existing OGN holders are able to [stake their OGN](ogn-staking.md) to participate in governance and earn incentives for driving value to OUSD.

The strong connection between OUSD and the rest of the Origin commerce platform will fuel growth in both initiatives.
