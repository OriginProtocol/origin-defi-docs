# 소개

## **더 나은 형태의 돈**

Origin Dollar \ (OUSD \) 는 Ethereum 네트워크에서 2020 년 9 월에 처음 출시된 새로운 스테이블코인(stablecoin) 입니다. OUSD는 단순히 지갑에 코인을 보관하기만 해도 경쟁력있는 수익률을 확보하기 때문에 기존 스테이블 코인보다 우수합니다.

1999 년 Origin의 R&D 엔지니어 인 Yu Pan과 그의 동료 PayPal 공동 창립자 [는 기존의 뱅킹 시스템에 연결하지 않고도 이자 수익률 전략과 직불 카드로 완성 된 "새로운 세계의 통화"를 만드는](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/david-sacks-cryptocurrency-interview.html) 것을 구상했습니다. Several pivots and an eBay acquisition later, PayPal dropped its ambitions in this area.

Almost two decades later, Tether introduced the concept of a USD-denominated stablecoin in 2014. Since then, stablecoins have proven themselves as an ideal way of transferring value without exposing users to the price volatility of free-floating currencies. Today, more value is [transferred via Tether](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-01/tether-not-bitcoin-likely-the-world-s-most-used-cryptocurrency) than with Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) has experienced an explosion of growth with [billions of dollars](https://defipulse.com/) of capital now locked up in smart contracts that generate yields from lending and trading protocols.

One of the problems with existing stablecoins is that users have to constantly choose between holding an easily spendable coin and earning yields by locking their tokens up in smart contracts. For example, users that lock up USDC in Aave cannot spend a portion of that USDC simultaneously. Expensive Ethereum gas fees serve as "switching costs" each time those users want to switch between spending mode and earning mode.

To make matters worse, yields from lending and trading activities change rapidly. Sophisticated DeFi yield earners are familiar with constantly having to rebalance their portfolio of assets across many competing platforms. This is time-consuming and expensive as gas fees once again eat into yields. In addition, it is time-consuming to calculate real ROI as APYs are unstable and constantly fluctuating. There isn't an easy unit of account. As a result, while DeFi is growing extremely rapidly, it still makes it difficult for many cryptocurrency users to participate.

With OUSD, there’s no need to unwind complicated positions when you want to spend your OUSD. You can transfer it freely without having to pay gas to unlock spendable capital. In addition, OUSD gives you access to some of the highest-earning opportunities across DeFi with none of the hassles. The OUSD smart contract will deploy your underlying capital to a diversified set of yield-earning strategies, rebalancing over time to achieve great yields while diversifying risk. Earnings automatically accrue in your wallet and compound continuously while you hold OUSD. Again, no staking or lockups are required. OUSD also serves as an ideal unit of account. DeFi investors no longer need complicated spreadsheets to calculate their earnings as they can easily see their constantly updated OUSD balances in real-time as their interest compounds automatically. OUSD is an ideal stablecoin for DeFi yield farmers and novice cryptocurrency users alike.
