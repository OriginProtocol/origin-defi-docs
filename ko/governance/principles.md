**점진적 탈 중앙화**

OUSD는 전 세계의 많은 이해 관계자들이 함께 관리하는 탈 중앙화 프로토콜로 설계되었습니다. We believe that the holders of OUSD should collectively determine important protocol decisions as soon as possible.

즉, 아주 초기 단계에는 오리진 팀의 핵심 엔지니어 팀이 프로토콜의 기초적인 부분 구축을 위해 신속하고 결단력 있게 행동해야 합니다.

탈 중앙화는 향후 몇 달 동안 4 단계에 걸쳐 빠르게 진행될 것입니다. 오리진은 가능한 한 빨리 커뮤니티에 통제 및 거버넌스를 양도하고자 합니다.

**Governance Portal**

OGN holders are encouraged to participate in creating and voting on proposals that impact the protocol in the [OGN governance portal](https://vote.originprotocol.com). Anyone with at least 1,000 OGN in their wallet or staked in our OGN Staking contract can create a new proposal. All OGN holders are able to vote for proposals. Our desire is for our community to have a strong impact on the direction of Origin’s products, open-source codebase, and to have a voice in key business decisions and the overall direction of the project.

**Timelock**

Prior to full decentralized governance, we will implement a [timelock](../smart-contracts/api/timelock.md) in front of all admin function calls, giving OUSD users time to withdraw their funds if they have objections to our proposed upgrades.

**New and Existing Stakeholders**

OUSD is a new project founded by Origin Protocol [team](www.originprotocol.com/team) and will be supported by the existing Origin community as well as many new stakeholders that choose to mint, hold, use, and provide liquidity for OUSD.

In addition, we also want to ensure high participation from our existing Origin Token \(OGN\) holders and the millions of people in our community. Existing OGN holders are able to [stake their OGN](ogn-staking.md) to participate in governance and earn incentives for driving value to OUSD.

The strong connection between OUSD and the rest of the Origin commerce platform will fuel growth in both initiatives.
