# Introduction

#### **A Better Form of Money**

Origin Dollar \(OUSD\) is a new stablecoin that was initially launched in August 2020 on the Ethereum network. Its design is superior to existing stablecoins because OUSD captures highly-competitive yields while being passively held in wallets.

**Background**

Stablecoins have proven themselves as an ideal way of storing and transferring value across cryptocurrency networks without exposing users to the price volatility of free-floating currencies. Today, more value is [transferred via Tether](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-01/tether-not-bitcoin-likely-the-world-s-most-used-cryptocurrency) than with Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) has experienced an explosion of growth with [billions of dollars](https://defipulse.com/) of capital now locked up in smart contracts that generate yields from lending and trading protocols. 

One of the problems with existing stablecoins is that users have to constantly choose between holding an easily spendable coin and earning yields by locking their tokens up in smart contracts. For example, users that lock up USDC in Aave cannot spend a portion of that USDC simultaneously. Expensive Ethereum gas fees serve as "switching costs" each time those users want to switch between spending mode and savings mode. 

What makes matters worse is that yields from lending and trading activities change very quickly. Sophisticated DeFi yield earners are familiar with constantly having to rebalance their portfolio of assets across many competing platforms. This is time-consuming and expensive as gas fees once again eat into yields. As a result, while DeFi is growing extremely rapidly, it still makes it difficult for many cryptocurrency users to participate.

With OUSD, thereâ€™s no need to unwind complicated positions when you want to spend your OUSD. You can transfer it freely without having to pay gas to unlock spendable capital. In addition, OUSD gives you access to some of the highest-earning opportunities across DeFi with none of the hassles. The OUSD smart contract algorithmically routes your underlying capital to a diversified set of yield-earning strategies, rebalancing over time to achieve great yields while diversifying risk. Earnings automatically accrue in your wallet and compound continuously while you hold OUSD. Again, no staking or lockups are required. OUSD is an ideal stablecoin for DeFi yield farmers and novice cryptocurrency users alike.
