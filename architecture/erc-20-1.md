# ERC-20

OUSD is an ERC-20 compliant token with one novel property that is important to understand.

{% hint style="info" %}
Wallets & exchanges that wish to integrate OUSD should not cache token balances for OUSD as this value will change frequently as yield is accrued to token holders. 
{% endhint %}

The biggest difference separating OUSD from your average ERC-20 token is the way OUSD's`balanceOf()` function will return a variable amount based on the total value of the pool multiplied by the holder's stake in the pool. This difference is vital to understand, particularly for wallets and exchanges that wish to integrate the OUSD token. This value should be fetched in real-time instead of being cached since OUSD rebases frequently.
