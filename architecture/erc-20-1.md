# ERC-20

OUSD is a standard ERC-20 token with some novel properties that are critical to understand.

The biggest difference separating OUSD from your average ERC-20 token is the way the  `balanceOf()` function returns a variable amount based on the total value of the pool multiplied by the holder's stake in the pool. This difference is vital to understand, particularly for wallets and exchanges that wish to integrate the OUSD token.

{% hint style="info" %}
Wallets & exchanges that wish to integrate OUSD should not cache token balances for OUSD as this value will change frequently as yield is accrued to token holders.
