# Getting Started

These docs are intended to explain how OUSD works, communicate the potential risks and benefits, and provide a guide for developers who wish to contribute to our codebase or integrate OUSD into their products. Here are a few ways for you to dive in and get started.

**Mint or Redeem**

The OUSD Mint allows anyone to create or trade in OUSD tokens using our [DApp](www.ousd.com) and a web-3 enabled cryptocurrency wallet like [Metamask](https://www.metamask.io). This is the native way to get OUSD, especially if you want a large amount that could risk moving the market on other exchanges.

**Buy on Exchanges**

For small amounts, the easiest way to start earning with OUSD is to buy it on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.

In addition, we anticipate that OUSD will soon be widely available on additional decentralized and centralized exchanges.

**Adding OUSD to Your Wallet**

{% hint style="info" %}
The main ERC20 address for Origin Dollar \(OUSD\) is:   
**0x2A8e1E676Ec238d8A992307B495b45B3fEAa5e86**
{% endhint %}

If your OUSD does not automatically show up in your wallet, you should be able to add it manually using the address above. We want to have OUSD supported by as many wallets as possible and included on all the various lists of well-known tokens. We would greatly appreciate any help you can offer in this area. 

**Integrating OUSD**

OUSD is a non-standard ERC-20 token that requires custom integration work for most applications that wish to support it. In particular, it is important for developers to understand how our elastic supply works as this can easily cause unexpected behavior.

If you are a wallet provider or crypto exchange that is interested in supporting OUSD, please refer to the following guides:
