# ERC-20

OUSD and OETH are ERC-20 compliant tokens with one novel property (elastic supply) that is important to understand.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Wallets and exchanges that wish to integrate OUSD or OETH should not cache token balances as this value will change frequently as yield is accrued to token holders.
{% endhint %}

The biggest difference separating OUSD/OETH from your average ERC-20 token is the way the`balanceOf()` function will return a variable amount based on the total value of the vault multiplied by the holder's stake in the vault. This difference is vital to understand, particularly for wallets and exchanges that wish to integrate either token. This value should be fetched in real-time instead of being cached since both OUSD and OETH rebase frequently.
