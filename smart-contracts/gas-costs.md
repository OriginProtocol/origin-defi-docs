# Gas Costs

By design, OSUD is as inexpensive to transfer as any other ERC-20 token. However, minting, redeeming, and rebasing currently require more significant amounts of gas. ln future releases, we will look at opportunities to amortize the gas costs of maintaining the pool to all of the holders.

| Function | Min gas cost | Max gas cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| mint\(\) |  |  | Expensive |
| redeem\(\) |  |  | Extra expensive \(sorry\) |
| rebase\(\) |  |  | Callable by anyone at anytime |
| transfer\(\) |  |  | Similar to any other ERC-20 |
