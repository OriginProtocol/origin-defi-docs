# How it Works

#### 100% Backed and Stable

Origin Dollar \(OUSD\) is a non-standard ERC-20 token for the Ethereum network. 

OUSD is a stable currency that is backed 1:1 by other proven stablecoins like USDT, USDC and DAI. As a result, 1 OUSD should always be worth 1 USD.

1 OUSD = 1 USD

#### Minting OUSD

Users convert their existing stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI to OUSD at the official [Origin Dollar DApp](www.ousd.com). Issued OUSD begins accruing yield immediately.

#### A**utomated Yield Farming**

OUSD generates yields by deploying the underlying stablecoins that were deposited to the OUSD smart contract to other DeFi protocols such as Compound, Aave, Uniswap, and Curve. Collected interest, trading fees, and rewards tokens are pooled and liquidated to produce OUSD-denominated yields. The protocol programmatically moves assets in and out of different liquidity pools in order to provide the best yield to the holders of OUSD. 

#### **Elastic Supply**

The generated returns are passed on to the holders of OUSD via constant rebasing of the money supply. OUSD constantly adjusts the money supply in response to the yield the protocol has generated. This allows the price of OUSD to stay pegged at $1 while the balance in token holders' wallets adjust in real-time to reflect yields that have been earned by the protocol.

The end result is a stablecoin that is easy to spend and more desirable to hold than existing stablecoins.
