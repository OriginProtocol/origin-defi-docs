# Compound

Compound, Ethereum üzerine kurulmuş bir borç verme protokolü ve platformudur ve Eylül 2018'de piyasaya sürülmüştür. Kullanıcılar varlıklardan bileşik faiz kazanabilir veya teminat karşılığında ödünç alabilir. Desteklenen her varlık kendi likidite havuzunda toplanır ve faiz oranları arz ve talebe göre otomatik olarak ayarlanır.

Teminat bakiyeleri, temsil ettikleri dayanak varlığa göre zaman içinde otomatik olarak faiz tahakkuk eden ve değerde artış sağlayan ERC-20 cTokens ile temsil edilir. Users can borrow assets against the value of their cTokens. cTokens are freely transferable and can be used on many other DeFi protocols. cTokens can be redeemed for their underlying collateral at any time.

Compound is governed by COMP, an ERC-20 governance token. COMP holders can propose and vote on protocol changes or delegate their votes to someone else. COMP tokens are awarded pro rata to users of the protocol daily, split equally between borrowers and lenders. A large portion of the COMP token supply was retained by the Compound team, investors, and advisors.

Compound's total value locked \(TVL\) has quickly grown to nearly $800 million, making it one of the largest DeFi protocols. COMP has a circulating market cap of over $500 million.

Compound has undergone multiple security audits by OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits. The Compound protocol was formally verified by CertiK and has undergone economic stress testing by Gauntlet. Compound maintains a bug bounty program.
