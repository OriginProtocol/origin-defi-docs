# Insurance

OUSD holders can buy smart contract insurance to cover any losses that might result from any bugs or vulnerabilities in the OUSD contracts, including economic exploits (such as flash loans attacks). In addition, anyone who wants to make a financial bet on the security of our contracts can earn a yield by providing coverage.

DeFi coverage for OUSD is currently available via  [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io). This partnership allows for more effective risk management by OUSD holders while creating new opportunities for coverage providers to profit.
