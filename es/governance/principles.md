**Descentralización progresiva**

OUSD está diseñado para ser un protocolo descentralizado gobernado por muchas partes interesadas en todo el mundo. We believe that the holders of OUSD should collectively determine important protocol decisions as soon as possible.

Dicho esto, en los primeros días, es imperativo que el equipo de ingeniería central pueda actuar de manera rápida y decisiva para construir las partes fundamentales del protocolo.

La descentralización progresará rápidamente en cuatro fases durante los próximos meses. Nuestra intención es ceder el control y la gobernanza a la comunidad lo antes posible.

**Governance Portal**

OGN holders are encouraged to participate in creating and voting on proposals that impact the protocol in the [OGN governance portal](https://vote.originprotocol.com). Anyone with at least 1,000 OGN in their wallet or staked in our OGN Staking contract can create a new proposal. All OGN holders are able to vote for proposals. Our desire is for our community to have a strong impact on the direction of Origin’s products, open-source codebase, and to have a voice in key business decisions and the overall direction of the project.

**Timelock**

Prior to full decentralized governance, we will implement a [timelock](../smart-contracts/api/timelock.md) in front of all admin function calls, giving OUSD users time to withdraw their funds if they have objections to our proposed upgrades.

**New and Existing Stakeholders**

OUSD is a new project founded by Origin Protocol [team](www.originprotocol.com/team) and will be supported by the existing Origin community as well as many new stakeholders that choose to mint, hold, use, and provide liquidity for OUSD.

In addition, we also want to ensure high participation from our existing Origin Token \(OGN\) holders and the millions of people in our community. Existing OGN holders are able to [stake their OGN](ogn-staking.md) to participate in governance and earn incentives for driving value to OUSD.

The strong connection between OUSD and the rest of the Origin commerce platform will fuel growth in both initiatives.
