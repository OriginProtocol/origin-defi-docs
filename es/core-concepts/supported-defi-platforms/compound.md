# Compound

Compound es una plataforma y un protocolo de préstamos construido sobre Ethereum y lanzado en septiembre de 2018. Los usuarios pueden ganar intereses compuestos o tomar prestados activos con garantía. Cada activo respaldado se agrega en su propio grupo de liquidez y las tasas de interés se ajustan automáticamente en función de la oferta y la demanda.

Collateral balances are represented by ERC-20 cTokens, which automatically accrue interest and increase in value over time relative to the underlying asset they represent. Users can borrow assets against the value of their cTokens. cTokens are freely transferable and can be used on many other DeFi protocols. cTokens can be redeemed for their underlying collateral at any time.

Compound is governed by COMP, an ERC-20 governance token. COMP holders can propose and vote on protocol changes or delegate their votes to someone else. COMP tokens are awarded pro rata to users of the protocol daily, split equally between borrowers and lenders. A large portion of the COMP token supply was retained by the Compound team, investors, and advisors.

Compound's total value locked \(TVL\) has quickly grown to nearly $800 million, making it one of the largest DeFi protocols. COMP has a circulating market cap of over $500 million.

Compound has undergone multiple security audits by OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits. The Compound protocol was formally verified by CertiK and has undergone economic stress testing by Gauntlet. Compound maintains a bug bounty program.
