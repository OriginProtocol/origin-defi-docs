# Insurance

OUSD holders can buy smart contract insurance to cover any losses that might result from any bugs or vulnerabilities in the OUSD contracts, including economic exploits \(such as flash loans attacks\). In addition, anyone who wants to make a financial bet on the security of our contracts can earn a yield by providing coverage.

DeFi coverage for OUSD is currently available via Cover Protocol. Visit our [blog post announcement](https://medium.com/originprotocol/origin-dollar-ousd-insurance-now-available-from-cover-protocol-793440c5c8a) to learn more or select [Origin Dollar on the Cover Protocol Marketplace](https://app.coverprotocol.com/app/marketplace/protocols/ORIGIN) to get started.

We’re also exploring working with [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/) and other insurance providers. Origin intends to deploy significant capital and incentives to encourage people to provide coverage. We’ll be sharing more details in the near future.
