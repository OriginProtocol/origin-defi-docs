# FAQ

**Where can I buy OGV, OUSD, or OETH?**

Check out [Getting Started](https://docs.ousd.com/getting-started) to see a variety of options.

**What are the costs to mint and redeem?**

As with any Ethereum transaction, you will need ether to interact with Origin's smart contracts. We have taken measures to reduce gas usage where possible, but these costs can vary.

Anytime you mint or redeem OUSD or OETH, there will be an exchange rate applied to your stablecoins deposited or withdrawn. You can read more about this in [Price Oracles](https://docs.ousd.com/core-concepts/price-oracles).

To encourage long-term holders and to protect the protocol from attackers, an exit fee of 0.25% is charged on all redeems. You can read more about this in [How It Works](https://docs.ousd.com/how-it-works).

**How soon will my balance increase?**

The amount of OUSD or OETH in your wallet will grow each time there is a positive rebase event. You can read more about this in [Elastic Supply](https://docs.ousd.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply). The supply is currently rebased several times per day and is usually correlated with how many people are minting and redeeming.

**Why do OUSD and OETH not grow when held in Uniswap or other smart contracts?**

By default, rebase events don't affect the supply of OUSD or OETH that is sitting in smart contracts. These contracts can opt-in to receiving additional yield if they are capable of handling elastic supply tokens. You can read more about this in [Rebasing & Smart Contracts](https://docs.ousd.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts).

**How is it possible for the APY to be so high?**

You can read about our various strategies in [Yield Generation](https://docs.ousd.com/core-concepts/yield-generation). We currently get most of the yield from harvesting rewards tokens. Additionally, the yield increases as more OUSD is held in smart contracts that do not opt into rebasing since the underlying collateral continues to earn for the remaining holders.

**Why is my balance increasing at a slower rate than the advertised APY?**

Balances increase when the supply is rebased. But the size of each rebase varies wildly depending on how much the vault has earned since the last rebase. And while most rebases collect a small amount earnings from lending strategies, other rebases involve liquidating rewards tokens or collecting fees. As a result, the yield will vary significantly during short time periods.
